= Subtxt
:github_url: https://github.com/DocOps/subtxt

A simple find-and-replace tool using regular expressions to match and manipulate strings of text across multiple files.
This is a quick-and-dirty, multi-procedure, directory-wide file rewriter.
Subtxt takes a directory to process and a set of patterns to find and replace.

== Quickstart

[NOTE]
This utility requires Ruby runtime, which comes installed on Macs and most Linux distributions but requires a link:https://rubyinstaller.org/[download] and some legwork for Windows.

To *install*, run:

 gem install subtxt

To *use*: `subtxt -s path/to/files -p patterns.txt`, where `patterns.txt` is any file with any extension containing patterns in the following format:

[source,regex]
----
find pattern
replace pattern

(pattern|string|content)-(to)-(find)
\1 \2 replace

delete this text


regular expression pattern
tokenized substitute output

(Some text that needs) (to be split onto 2 lines)
\1\n\2

EOF
----

For each pair of strings, the first becomes the search pattern and the second becomes the replace pattern.
Follow each pair with a blank line.
To delete matched patterns, simply replace with nothing by providing a blank line.
End the file with `EOF` on its own line.

See `subtxt --help` for more.

== Including Subtxt into a Ruby Application

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'subtxt'
----

And then execute:

 bundle

Or install it yourself as:

 gem install subtxt


== Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to link:https://rubygems.org[rubygems.org].
